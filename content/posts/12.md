In this article, we are going to see how can easily create charts in Livewire 3 and Volt. For that, we will use the [asantibanez/livewire-charts](https:://github.com/asantibanez/livewire-charts) package.

First, we need to create a fresh Laravel application, and install the `laravel/folio`, `livewire/livewire`, `asantibanez/livewire-charts`, `livewire/volt` packages:

```bash
laravel new stats-app
cd stats-app

composer require laravel/folio:^1.0@beta livewire/livewire:^3.0@beta livewire/volt:^1.0@beta asantibanez/livewire-charts
```

Next, let's run the "install" commands for the packages we've just required:

```bash
php artisan folio:install
php artisan volt:install
php artisan livewire-charts:install
```

After, let's create a new Folio page to display our charts:

```bash
php artisan make:folio stats
```

This command will create an `resources/views/pages/stats.blade.php` file. And, as reminder, Folio's blade views automatically create a route that matches the view's path. So, in this case, we will have a `/stats` route.

Let's open this file and replace its content with the following:

```php
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Stats</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <livewire:expenses />

        @livewireChartsScripts
    </body>
</html>
```

Note that, we have added the `@livewireChartsScripts` Blade directive as required by the `asantibanez/livewire-charts` package. And we are also including the `livewire:expenses` component. Let's create this component now:

```bash
php artisan make:volt expenses
```

This command will create an `resources/views/livewire/expenses.blade.php` file. So, let's open this file and replace its content with the following:

```php
<?php

use function Livewire\Volt\{computed, state};
use Asantibanez\LivewireCharts\Models\PieChartModel;

state(food: 0, shopping: 0, travel: 0);

$incrementFood = fn () => $this->food++;
$incrementShopping = fn () => $this->shopping++;
$incrementTravel = fn () => $this->travel++;

$expenses = computed(fn () => (new PieChartModel())
    ->setTitle('Expenses by Type')
    ->addSlice('Food', $this->food, '#f6ad55')
    ->addSlice('Shopping', $this->shopping, '#fc8181')
    ->addSlice('Travel', $this->travel, '#90cdf4'));

?>

<div>
    <button wire:click="incrementFood">+ Food</button>
    <button wire:click="incrementShopping">+ Shopping</button>
    <button wire:click="incrementTravel">+ Travel</button>

    <livewire:livewire-pie-chart
        key="{{ $this->expenses->reactiveKey() }}"
        :pie-chart-model="$this->expenses"
    />

</div>
```

Finally, if you `php artisan serve` our application, and we visit the `/stats` page, you will see the following:

![Stats App Preview](https://nunomaduro.com/12_stats_app_preview.png)

If you click on the buttons, you will see the chart updating. Every time you click on a button, the `food`, `shopping`, or `travel` state will be incremented. And the chart will be updated accordingly because our chart model is a "computed" property.

And that's it! We have built a simple Chart application using Laravel Folio, Livewire, Livewire Charts, and Volt. If you want to learn more about these four packages, check out their documentation:
