In case you missed it, at Laravel, we recently released two new packages:

- [Folio](https://blog.laravel.com/introducing-folio-page-based-routing): a powerful page-based router designed to simplify routing in Laravel applications.
- [Volt](https://blog.laravel.com/introducing-volt-an-elegantly-crafted-functional-api-for-livewire): an elegantly crafted functional API for Livewire, allowing component's PHP logic and Blade templates to coexist in the same file.

In this article, we will build a simple Todo application using these two packages. To get started, let's first create a new Laravel application:

```bash
laravel new todo-app
cd todo-app
```

After, let's create a new `Todo` model and migration:

```bash
php artisan make:model Todo -m
```

Next, let's add the column `description` to the `database/migrations/2023_xx_xx_xxxxxx_create_todos_table.php` migration:

```php
Schema::create('todos', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('description'); // <-- Add this line
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

And, let's allow the `description` column to be mass assignable in the `app/Models/Todo.php` model:

```php
class Todo extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $fillable = [
        'description', // <-- Add this line
    ];
}
```

After, lets set `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` in the `.env` file and run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

At this point, we are ready to start building the "front-end" of our application. To do so, let's install the `laravel/folio` and `livewire/volt` packages:

```bash
composer require laravel/folio:^1.0@beta livewire/livewire:^3.0@beta livewire/volt:^1.0@beta
```

Next, let's install both Folio and Volt:

```bash
php artisan folio:install
php artisan volt:install
```

After, let's create a new Folio page to list all the todos:

```bash
php artisan make:folio todos
```

This command will create an `resources/views/pages/todos.blade.php` file. Let's open this file and replace its content with the following:

```php
<?php

use function Livewire\Volt\state;
use App\Models\Todo;

state(description: '', todos: fn () => Todo::all());

$addTodo = function () {
    Todo::create(['description' => $this->description]);

    $this->description = '';
    $this->todos = Todo::all();
}; ?>

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Todos</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    @volt
        <div>
            <h1>Add Todo </h1>
            <form wire:submit="addTodo">
                <input type="text" wire:model="description">
                <button type="submit">Add</button>
            </form>

            <h1>Todos</h1>
            <ul>
                @foreach ($todos as $todo)
                    <li>{{ $todo->description }}</li>
                @endforeach
            </ul>
        </div>
    @endvolt
    </body>
</html>
```

And finally, lets `php artisan serve` our application and visit the `/todos` route:

Note that we are using the `@volt` Blade directive to create an anonymous directly in our Folio page. This simply a shortcut to not have to create a new `<livewire:todos />` component in a separate file.

And that's it! We have built a simple Todo application using Laravel Folio and Volt. If you want to learn more about these two packages, check out their documentation:

- [Volt Documentation](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/volt)

We hope you enjoy this new addition to the Laravel and Livewire ecosystems. At Laravel, we're committed to providing you with the most robust and developer friendly PHP experience in the world. Build something amazing!
